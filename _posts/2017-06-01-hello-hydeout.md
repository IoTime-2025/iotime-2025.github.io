IoTime 2025 is a workshop held in conjunction with the **[IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference](https://wcnc2025.ieee-wcnc.org/)** on 24-27 March 2025 (Milan, Italy).

CALL FOR TECHNICAL PAPERS
---------------------------

Time is an essential constraint for most components of an IoT system, such as sensors, actuators, and applications. The IoTime workshop focuses on applications, architectures, and solutions for IoT-based systems where time plays a crucial role. Precise time and timeliness in task execution are fundamental requirements for emerging IoT applications, including Industry 4.0, mobile and collaborative robots, autonomous systems, and immersive and interactive human-cyber experiences.

Original, unpublished contributions are welcomed in time-critical applications for the Internet of Things. Time is a crucial and sensitive matter in most IoT-based systems and applications. Smart factories, mobile and collaborative robots, autonomous systems, and virtual/mixed reality are examples of the next wave of applications that rely on accurate time and bounded (low) latency computing and communications. The IoTime Workshop looks for cutting-edge approaches in the whole IoT vertical - from sensors to applications - in which time plays a significant factor.

TOPICS
---------------------------

- Wireless time-sensitive networking to achieve secure, reliable, low-latency wireless communications.
- Wireless time-sensitive networking for AR/VR use cases.
- Real test-beds, proofs-of-concept, pilot site descriptions, and industry experience where time plays a crucial role.

* **Keynote**: Time Critical IoT for Industrial Automation: the Communication and System Perspectives - Prof. Zhibo Pang. <br>
**Abstract:** Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) is one of the engines that have driven the 4th revolution of industries, or so-called Industry 4.0. From the communication and system perspectives, the industrial automation applications introduce not only stringent requirements in latency, reliability, and time synchronization, but also essential challenges to security, functional safety, and interoperability. In this talk, I will introduce the use cases and motivate the technical requirements from system perspectives. Then some latest progresses from academia and industry will be reported. Open challenges and promising directions of future research will be discussed in the end.  
* BPA and final remarks - 15 min -->
